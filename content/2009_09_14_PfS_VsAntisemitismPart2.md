> Rabbi Hicks talks with Bubba Matsumoto: the continued opening of an American mind.

![Hicks to Bubba: "Bubba, we're going to the Holocaust Museum, Saturday. Wanna come with?"
Bubba, with sarcasm, not enthusiasm: "Wow. Fun."](2009_09_14_r1p1_PfS-AntiS2_1_.png)
![Bubba to Hicks: "I dunno, Rabbi Hicks. Is that stuff for real?"
Hicks to Bubba: "Bubba, have you seen 'Superman 2'?"
Bubba: "Yeah."](2009_09_14_r1p2_PfS-AntiS2_2_.png)
![Panel shows a shot of cars flying into a pile, and another shot with the three evil Kryptonians, standing side by side, in their pleather armor, using their super-breath.  Behind them are THE TRAFFIC CONES OF STEEL which are actually ordinary orange rubber, but they aren't moving, at all, despite the super wind.
Hicks: "Remember how all of the evil Kryptonians used their breath to blow cars down the street?"
Bubba: "Yeah."](2009_09_14_r1p3_PfS-AntiS2_3_.png)

![Scene is in the butcher shop, again.
Hicks to Bubba: "Did you notice that NOTHING at ALL moves behind them, not even styrofoam cups?"
Bubba: "... Oh, wow - you're right!"](2009_09_14_r2p1_PfS-AntiS2_4_.png)
![Scene is of half a dozen starved concentration camp captives, in striped  uniforms, each distinguished by a different kind of cloth triangle, sewed to the shirt.
Hicks to Bubba: "That's what it's like, when Holocaust deniers NEVER deny anything about the other 5 MILLION - Slavs, Poles, Roma (commonly called Gypsies), politicals, Jehovah's Witnesses, gays, and disabled people, and Freemasons."](2009_09_14_r2p2_PfS-AntiS2_5_.png)
![Back to the kosher butcher shop that doesn't kill animals, where Bubba says "... Okay ... I guess I wanna see what the other side has to show. What time are you going?"](2009_09_14_r2p3_PfS-AntiS2_6_.png)
