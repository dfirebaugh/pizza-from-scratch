Hicks to Bubba: "What is it, Bubba?"](/images/2009_09_21_r1p1_PfS-AntiS4_1_.png)
![Bubba to Hicks: "Um, no offense meant, but ... well ... movies, TV, museums - if I don't see Jews all through the media, all my skinhead militia friends tell me, endlessly, that Jews are everywhere."](/images/2009_09_21_r1p2_PfS-AntiS4_2_.png)
![Bubba to Hicks, again: "But aren't your people in the media only trying to win over America?"
Hicks to Bubba: "Pretty much, Bubba."](/images/2009_09_21_r1p3_PfS-AntiS4_3_.png)
![Bubba to Hicks: "But then some people complain like ... in 'Blazing Saddles,' when  ... Heady?"
Hicks to Bubba: "Headley."

Bubba and Hicks, together: "'Too jewish.'"](/images/2009_09_21_r1p4_PfS-AntiS4_4_.png)
