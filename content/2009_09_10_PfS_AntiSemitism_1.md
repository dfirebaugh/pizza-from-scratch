![Rabbi Hicks says to Count Vito "So, Vito, when're you going to ask me about  our name?"](2009_09_10_r1p1_PfS-AntiS1_1_.png)
![Count Vito  Rabbi Hicks: "Oh, I'm guessing the usual reasons: assimilation on the surface; hiding in plain sight, from bigots."](2009_09_10_r1p2_PfS-AntiS1_2_.png)
![Hicks to Vito: "Yes, you'd be surprised how many people think 'They're all bad, except for all the ones I know personally."
Vito to Hicks: "Oh, at my age, not much surprises me."](2009_09_10_r1p3_PfS-AntiS1_3_.png)
![Bubba Matsumoto to Rabbi Hicks: "Hey, Rabbi Hicks!"
Hicks to  Bubba: "Yes, Bubba?"
Bubba to Hicks:  "You're right: this is bull. No one calls themselves 'evil' except in the movies." (Bubba is critically reading The Protocols of the Elders of  Zion, a work of fiction.)
Count Vito, to Bubba, adds "... and melodramas."
Bubba to Vito: "What?"
Vito to Bubba: "Old-style plays. Think 'Snidely Whiplash.'
Bubba to Vito: "Oh. Okay."](2009_09_10_r1p4_PfS-AntiS1_4_.png)
