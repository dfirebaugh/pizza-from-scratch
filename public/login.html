<!-- I can understand that this works through something stored in Github.  I know this was fine for the class project.
	 Outside of the class project, is this a potentail security problem, should someone take offense to one of my cartoons, and decide
	 to mess with our code on Github?  I guess Github doesn't work that way.  "Pull requests" are only requests.  How do I screen pull
	 requests?
