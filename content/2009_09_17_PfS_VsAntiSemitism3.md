# Pizza from Scratch, Vs. Anti-Semitism, part 3

Wed Sep 16 2009

> Three families, and Bubba Matsumoto, visit the Virginia Holocaust Museum, where an exhibit shows Nazi mental inconsistency.  Rabbi Hicks is wearing a Star Trek original series Enterprise scout mission symbol themed yarmulke.  And someone is going to say "No! It;s a keffah!"
        

![Scene is an exhibit showing two Nazi scientific experiments. There's one manikin, in a striped camp uniform, in a tube from which air can be extracted, to simulate high altitude.  Another manikin is   also wearing a flotation vest, but is in an open-topped tank, full of ice water.  Two families of cats, Rabbi Hicks and family, and Bubba Matsumoto are looking at the displays.
Rabbi Hicks says "Nazi scientists used Jewish prisoners for experiments, to find out how long German airmen could survive thin air of high altitude bailouts, and landing in freezing ocean water."
Peter, a young kitten with big granny glasses, says "Hey, waitaminit ... The Nazis always bragged 'Germans are way better than everyone else,' right?"](/images/2009_09_17_r1p1_PfS-AntiS3_1_.png)

![Peter asks "So, would these 'speriments show if Germans would survive?"](/images/2009_09_17_r1p2_PfS-AntiS3_2_.png)
![Peter holds his head, because it hurts, and says "I mean, if Germans 're so great, then the 'speriments don't show what Germans can do."](/images/2009_09_17_r2p1_PfS-AntiS3_3_.png)
![Peter throws up his hands in frustration, saying "... But if the 'speriments counted, then the Jews were just as tough as the Germans, and the Nazis were wrong. Why didn't they see it?"](/images/2009_09_17_r3p1_PfS-AntiS3_4_.png)
![Peter's uncle, the hairless cat, M. Lux Luther, Ph/D, answers. "Peter, their kind of thinking comes from intellectual inbreeding. It's just as bad on the right as it is on the left."](/images/2009_09_17_r4p1_PfS-AntiS3_5_.png)
