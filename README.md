This is a website worked on with 
[Bill Lemmond](https://github.com/Pastshelfdate) to publish his cartoons.


### Serving up the site for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Adding Content
Content exists in MarkDown Files in the `content` folder.

You can read up on how to write markdown files [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

Typically, you will want to make a new folder for each post and place the images that belong in that post in the same folder.

Each markdown file should start with some metadata at the top of the file.
e.g.: 
```
---
title: example post 2
description: this is just another example file for testing
date: 09-02-2020
slug: example-post 2
---
```

`slug` must be unique as it is used to reference the post in the code.
